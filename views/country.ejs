                Cairo is Egypt's sprawling capital city. As the largest city in Africa and the 6th largest city in the world, Cairo has so much to see and do. Located on the banks of the Nile River, Cairo, holds the special distinction of being home to the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing: the Great Pyramid, completed around 2540 B.C, just outside the city on the Giza Plateau. This city is full of rich history, exciting experiences, delicious coffees, and fabulous food. You will be amazed by the local culture, food  and shopping opportunities the city will offer, plus you will have the opportunity to go back in time to a world where Pharaohs ruled the region.
